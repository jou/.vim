# Why?

Got sick of

1. The big honking mess that is my Vim configuration on my work machine
2. That big honking mess taking ages to load sometimes
3. Getting confused when I use Vim at my machine at home

## Installation

Run the `init` rake task

    rake init

it takes care of updating the git submodules and symlinking `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`
